Sometimes I want to understand the GC performance impact on an application quickly.
I know that there are many powerful diagnostic tools and approaches,
  but I'm a fan of the "right tool for the job" idea.
In simple cases, I prefer simple noninvasive approaches which provide a quick way
  to get an overview of the current situation
  (if everything is terrible, I always can switch to an advanced approach).
Today I want to share with you my favorite way to quickly get statistics
  of GC pauses in Mono and generate nice plots like this:

@Raw(Model.Image("plot-64.png"))

### Getting raw data

Mono has internal tools for getting brief data about GC events.
You just should set a few environment variables:

```
export MONO_LOG_LEVEL=debug
export MONO_LOG_MASK=gc
```

As a result, we will get lines like follows in stdout:

```ini

```

Here we can find a lot of interesting information.
However, it's raw data, and it's not easy to manually process such logs
  (especially if you have hundreds of lines).
Let's parse it and aggregate the most important data about GC pauses.

### The script

I use the following simple regular expression for capturing most interesting lines: `^Mono: GC_(.{5}).*time ([0-9\\.]*)ms`
  (you can find an online version
  [here](https://regex101.com/r/wovoAs/1) and
  [here](https://regexper.com/#%5EMono%3A%20GC_(.%7B5%7D).*time%20(%5B0-9%5C%5C.%5D*)ms)).

@Raw(Model.Image("regex.png"))

Usually, I use R for simple statistics/plotting tasks.
Here is my script for processing such logs (assuming that we have the full log in `output.txt`):

```r
library(ggplot2);library(dplyr);library(stringr)

lines <- readLines("output.txt")
df <- data.frame(str_match(lines, "^Mono: GC_(.{5}).*time ([0-9\\.]*)ms"))[,2:3]
colnames(df) <- c("type", "time")
df$time <- as.double(as.character(df$time))
df <- df %>% filter(type != "NA")

ggplot(df, aes(x=time, color=type)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_grid(.~type, scales = "free")
ggsave("plot.png")

summary(df %>% filter(type == "MINOR"))
summary(df %>% filter(type == "MAJOR"))
```

### Case study

Once, I decided to play with the `nursery-size` value in [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/).
The default value is `4 MB`, but it's not the optimal value for Rider.
Let's open a simple solution in Rider and look at the statistics.

#### nursery-size=4m

@Raw(Model.Image("plot-4.png"))

```bash
> summary(df %>% filter(type == "MINOR"))
    type           time       
 MAJOR:   0   Min.   : 0.320  
 MINOR:2029   1st Qu.: 6.990  
              Median : 8.670  
              Mean   : 8.664  
              3rd Qu.: 9.910  
              Max.   :84.190  

> summary(df %>% filter(type == "MAJOR"))
    type         time        
 MAJOR:20   Min.   :  68.16  
 MINOR: 0   1st Qu.: 168.90  
            Median : 237.40  
            Mean   : 339.33  
            3rd Qu.: 402.62  
            Max.   :1068.22 
```

#### nursery-size=64m

@Raw(Model.Image("plot-64.png"))

```bash
> summary(df %>% filter(type == "MINOR"))
    type          time       
 MAJOR:  0   Min.   :  3.42  
 MINOR:273   1st Qu.: 11.72  
             Median : 15.01  
             Mean   : 22.72  
             3rd Qu.: 20.79  
             Max.   :379.26  

> summary(df %>% filter(type == "MAJOR"))
    type         time        
 MAJOR:18   Min.   :  22.94  
 MINOR: 0   1st Qu.: 176.00  
            Median : 317.68  
            Mean   : 397.17  
            3rd Qu.: 567.48  
            Max.   :1052.87  
```

The average time of `GC_MINOR` is bigger for `64 M` (`22.72ms` vs. `8.664ms`),
  but the amount of `GC_MINOR` collections is `273` instead of `2029`!

#### Performance impact

Does it really affect the performance?
Let's find out!
I checked a subset of the Rider solution (212 projects) on Ubuntu 16.04.
I measured the startup time
  (the time before solution is fully loaded include the full product initialization).
I have analyzed the full distributions, but let's look only at average numbers for simplification.
The results:

```ini
Mono 4.8
nursery-size=4m      -> Time = ~75sec
nursery-size=64m     -> Time = ~47sec

Mono 5.2
nursery-size=4m      -> Time = ~95sec
nursery-size=64m     -> Time = ~40sec
```

After many additional checks on different solutions,
  the nursery size was changed to `64 MB` in Rider 2017.2,
  it improved the startup experience for Linux and macOS users on huge solutions.

### Default way to get statistics

You can also run mono with the `--stats` arguments and get a lot of useful information includes a report about GC.
It looks like follows:

```
GC statistics
Collection max time                 : 79.32 ms
Minor fragment clear                : 0.01 ms
Minor pinning                       : 6.78 ms
Minor scan remembered set           : 124.51 ms
Minor scan major blocks             : 47.46 ms
Minor scan los                      : 67.16 ms
Minor scan pinned                   : 0.01 ms
Minor scan roots                    : 14.70 ms
Minor fragment creation             : 1.38 ms
Major fragment clear                : 0.12 ms
Major pinning                       : 12.85 ms
Major scan pinned                   : 0.01 ms
Major scan roots                    : 128.16 ms
Major scan mod union blocks         : 48.61 ms
Major scan mod union los            : 4.63 ms
Major finish gray stack             : 190.74 ms
Major free big objects              : 0.00 ms
Major LOS sweep                     : 6.57 ms
Major sweep                         : 0.08 ms
Major fragment creation             : 0.56 ms
Number of pinned objects            : 11933
World stop                          : 7.60 ms
World restart                       : 2.77 ms
# major blocks allocated            : 9952
# major blocks freed                : 6202
# major blocks lazy swept           : 11
# major blocks freed ideally        : 2528
# major blocks freed less ideally   : 3674
# major blocks freed individually   : 0
# major blocks allocated less ideally: 0
# workers finished                  : 14
Memgov alloc                        : 190944712
Memgov max alloc                    : 318818244
Minor GC collections                : 14
Major GC collections                : 10
Minor GC time                       : 420.70 ms
Major GC time                       : 434.76 ms
Major GC time concurrent            : 757.94 ms
```

It's also a very useful trick, but I prefer to look at the distribution,
  so I typically collect full information about all GC collections.

### Conclusion

When you start a performance investigation,
  you don't know the current runtime characteristics in advance.
These characteristics can be useful for initial hypotheses.
It's great when you can collect some high-level data without additional tools.
I like to start with a quick and dirty checks which allow me
  to get a first impression about the current situation.

Of course, you usually need advanced profiling tools for full performance investigations.
And you should use it at the end for verifying your hypotheses and making final conclusions.
But it's not always should be the first step because it takes too much time.
Also profilers are typically invasive tools,
  the default [Mono log profiler](http://www.mono-project.com/docs/debug+profile/profile/profiler/) has huge overhead.
`MONO_LOG_LEVEL=debug` is a non invasive approach with low overhead,
  you need only ten seconds for the setup and
  you can run it on a customer computer without additional tools.
Data can be processed with a small R script which can be easily modified
  if you want to calculate some advanced statistics.
